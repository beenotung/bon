= BON =

Binary Object Notation,
A.K.A. Beeno Object Notation

Based on stackish.

Designed to enable loss-less data exchange between Erlang to Javascript.

Loss-less means it will not mess up tuple and list, nor atom and hashmap key

integer is represented in dec format, e.g. 42
floating number is represented in rational format (of integer), e.g. 314/100
